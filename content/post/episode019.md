Last night we had a great discussion about Pokémon Go - our enthusiasm for the underlying technology, where we think it can go next, and some definite privacy and safety concerns. I think it's a well-rounded discussion, and I hope you all can take a few minutes to check out the video below, and follow our [SATechDad page on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SATechDad/). Thanks!
