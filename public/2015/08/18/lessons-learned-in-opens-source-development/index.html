          <h4>Lessons Learned in Opens Source Development</h4>
          <p>
          
          </p>
          <p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re curious how a Windows developer would go about starting an open source project, you aren&rsquo;t alone. In fact, our most recent Office Hours Hangout guest, Don Schecnk, found himself ready to start an open source project, and didn&rsquo;t know where to start. Fortunately for us, he documented his process, and spoke with us about it on our hangout. We didn&rsquo;t just cover the process, we also covered the product of his efforts, PoshStack, the PowerShell client for OpenStack. I&rsquo;m including a few selected highlights, but the entire video can be viewed below. This was a fun interview - I know I learned a lot.</p>

<h2 id="poshstack:f8f7ec867f77ab40852c5bdf31ec7080">PoshStack</h2>

<p>We started our conversation by speaking about PowerShell: what it is, why developers and administrators use it. Don related the <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=3m29s">story of PoshStack came to be</a>. Don also shared a story of being able to <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=9m9s">spin up dozens of servers</a> for a training event. PoshStack made it possible to automate that deployment (and subsequent spin down). Another task for PoshStack is to work in conjunction with a configuration management solution, such as Ansible. Don himself worked with the creators of Ansible to build the Windows version of Ansible, and enjoys the <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=15m23s">consistent environment</a> he&rsquo;s able to reproduce with these tools. I really appreciated how this bit of the conversation was an extension of our Hangout last week, with <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/ansible-certified-engineer-justin-phelps-video/">Ansible Certified Engineer Justin Phelps</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-experience-of-building-an-open-source-project:f8f7ec867f77ab40852c5bdf31ec7080">The experience of building an open source project</h2>

<p>PoshStack is a great tool for anyone working extensively on Windows severs. It&rsquo;s also a great case study in building an open source project. Don is new to open source, so he decided to document his <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=19m15s">experiences building an open source project?</a>, eventually turning his experience into a presentation given at various conferences. During our conversation, Don outlined several <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=21m20s">lessons learned</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=29m11s">tools used</a>, and things he would have <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=36m16s">done differently</a>. I enjoyed chatting with Don on these points; they&rsquo;re great advice for anyone interested in getting started in open source, and probably even a few with plenty of experience. Among the things to try differently, I found his advice around slowing down to be especially helpful. Don recommended paying extra attention to the README file. That introduction to your project should give potential users and contributers a solid foundation to start with. Don recommended that <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=38m1s">each README contain four characteristics</a>: A description, a list of prerequisites, complete installation instructions, and notes on how to contribute. Most importantly, Don encourages anyone interested in working on a project to <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=42m50s">just get out there and start contributing</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rack-cli:f8f7ec867f77ab40852c5bdf31ec7080">rack cli</h2>

<p>We wrapped up our conversation with a <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=43m38s">discussion</a> on the new <a href="https://developer.rackspace.com/blog/introducing-rack-global-cli/">rack command line interface</a> for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Rack cli is very easy to install and configure - I was able to get up and running in about 5 minutes. The interface allows the user to command Cloud Servers, Cloud Files, Cloud Block Storage, and Cloud Networks. Rack cli even <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=45m13s">integrates well with PoshStack</a>; users can send rack cli output directly into PoshStack for further work.</p>

<p>I truly enjoyed chatting with Don. <a href="https://youtu.be/u7dlGhhQ48k?t=53m28s">It&rsquo;s obvious that he loves his job</a>, and that love shows in the amazing tools he&rsquo;s built. You can view the entire discussion below, and don&rsquo;t forget to check out our next hangout, Thursday at 1pm.</p>
